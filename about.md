Hi there! I'm Tina, a technology professional based in Austria. I currently work as Senior Product Manager for GitHub Actions. I hold a degree in software engineering and started my journey as a software developer. 

Outside of the tech realm, I'm involved in equine nutrition consulting as a side business, leveraging my love for horses. I enjoy outdoor activities such as horseback riding and hiking and have a passion for music. Additionally, I'm a trained paramedic with over a decade of experience in preclinical emergency care, volunteering at the ambulance service of the Austrian Red Cross.
