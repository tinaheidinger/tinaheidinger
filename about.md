Hi there! I'm Tina, a technology professional based in Austria. I currently work as Senior Product Manager for supply chain security at [GitHub](https://github.com/tinaheidinger/). I hold a degree in software engineering and started my career as a software developer, but over time, I found my way into product.

Outside of tech, I run a [side business](https://pferdestaerken.at/) consulting horse owners on equine nutrition and creating [educational content](https://pferdewissen.at/). When I'm not working, you'll often find me outdoors, horseback riding or hiking in the mountains with my dog.

Additionally, I'm a trained paramedic with over a decade of experience in preclinical emergency care. I also have a wonderful rescue dog who turned out to by the loveliest companion. We're currently training for her to become a certified therapy dog so she can spread her love and connection to those who need it most.

Thanks for stopping by - I'd love to connect!
